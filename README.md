## Introduction
In this project, we have implemented a custom RNN model using PyTorch. This RNN model is designed for a specific task, such as text classification, time series prediction, or sequence generation. The architecture of the RNN includes two RNN layers, which are suitable for capturing sequential dependencies in the data.

## Dependencies
Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.10)
- PyTorch (>=2.0.1+cu118)
- Other necessary Python libraries (NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install PyTorch and other dependencies using pip or conda, depending on your environment.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/g-hano/Fraud-Detection-with-RNN.git
   ```

2. **Customize the Model:**
   Modify the RNN architecture in the `rnn_model.py` file to suit your specific task. You can adjust the number of hidden units, input dimensions, and output dimensions based on your dataset and problem.

3. **Prepare Your Data:**
   Prepare your dataset in a format suitable for training an RNN model. You may need to preprocess your data, split it into training and testing sets, and create data loaders.

4. **Inference:**
   Use the trained model for making predictions or generating sequences, depending on your task. Modify the `inference.py` script to suit your specific inference requirements.
